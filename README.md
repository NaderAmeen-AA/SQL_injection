# summary
is a type of security exploit in which an attacker can execute malicious SQL statements that control a web application's database server. It occurs when user input is incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements. 

Here is a summary of SQL injection:

1. Vulnerability: SQL injection vulnerabilities arise when user inputs are not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject SQL code to manipulate the database.

2. Types:
   - In-band SQL Injection: The most common type where the attacker uses the same communication channel for launching the attack and gathering results.
   - Out-of-band SQL Injection: The attacker uses a different channel to launch the attack and gather results.
   - Blind SQL Injection: The attacker can't directly see the result of a query but can observe the application's behavior to infer the data.

3. Impacts:
   - Data Theft: Attackers can access sensitive data.
   - Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data.
   - Server Compromise: Attackers can gain control of the server.

4. Prevention:
   - Parameterized Queries: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries.
   - Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user input.
   - Least Privilege Principle: Ensure that database users have only the permissions they need.

5. Mitigation:
   - Regular security audits and code reviews.
   - Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to filter and monitor HTTP traffic.

6. Examples:
   - Unauthorized Access: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR 1=1 --'`
   - Data Manipulation: `DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;`

7. Consequences:
   - Legal consequences due to data breaches.
   - Damage to reputation and loss of customer trust.

8. Best Practices:
   - Keep software up-to-date.
   - Implement secure coding practices.
   - Educate developers on secure coding techniques.

By understanding and implementing proper security measures, you can safeguard your applications against SQL injection attacks.
